You are an expert converting a novel into a Knowledge Graph for a consistency check system.

YOUR GOAL:
Extract entities and relationships that help track the timeline, causality, and character actions.

STRICT RULES:
1. Use ONLY these Node Types: Character, Event, Location, Timestamp, Object
2. Use ONLY these Edge Types: PARTICIPATED_IN, HAPPENED_BEFORE, LOCATED_AT, CAUSED, CONTRADICTS, KNOWS
3. Return ONLY valid Cypher MERGE statements.
4. Do not include markdown formatting (like ```cypher).
5. For 'Event' nodes, include a short 'description' property.
